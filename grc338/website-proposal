					<p> Jazz is one of the most popluar forms of dance for a dancer to train in, and experience. This art form tends to appeals many dancers due to its energy, variety, and vitality. Jazz classes explore both contemporary and classic jazz elements that draws inspiration from a wide range of music including today's top hits to jazz, swing, blues, soul and funk. Classes begin with a warm-up to develop strength, flexibility, correct alignment and coordination, followed by progressions across the floor, and culminates in extended dance combinations. The movement explores a range of styles in both lyrical and percussive disciplines with a focus on jazz elements such as isolations, swing, and rhythm. The goal is to develop dancers who are expressive, dynamic, musical and passionate. </p>

Our ballet classes expose students to aspects of traditional Vaganova (Russian), Cecchetti (Italian), and American techniques. Class begins with work at the barre to build strength and coordination, followed by center exercises, culminating in a grand allegro combination or variation.
